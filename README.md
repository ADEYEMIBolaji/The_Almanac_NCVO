**Task Description:**

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the NCVO Data Scientist Interview Task. This repository contains a synthetic dataset representing the UK Civil Society Almanac, which encompasses financial data related to charities in the United Kingdom. It's important to note that this dataset is synthetic, meaning it has been artificially generated to simulate real-world data patterns and characteristics.

The primary objective of this task, documented within this repository, was to perform data wrangling and analysis on the synthetic dataset to extract valuable insights into the financial landscape of charities. Specifically, the task involved merging two datasets: the Charity Commission register and the UK-CAT classification categories, to create a unified dataset of active charities along with their corresponding UK-CAT category tags.

Additionally, the task required generating a summary table reporting various statistics, such as the number of charities and the average, minimum, and maximum annual incomes across different categories of charities in England. To achieve this, data wrangling techniques including data splitting, function application, and filtering were employed.

It's crucial to acknowledge that while the trends and patterns observed in the analysis provide valuable insights for exploratory purposes, this synthetic dataset does not accurately depict the true state of organizations within the UK Civil Society Almanac. Therefore, the findings should be interpreted with caution and may not reflect real-world scenarios accurately.

This repository serves as a demonstration of proficiency in handling and deriving insights from complex datasets through data manipulation, analysis, and visualization techniques. Feel free to explore the code and documentation provided to gain a deeper understanding of the data science tasks undertaken in this project.
